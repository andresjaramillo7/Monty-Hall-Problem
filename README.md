# 🎲 Monty Hall Simulator

An interactive simulation of the famous **Monty Hall Problem**, built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.

## 🤔 What is the Monty Hall Problem?

A classic probability puzzle inspired by a game show. You're presented with three doors: behind one is a prize (a car), and behind the other two, goats. After you pick a door, the host (who knows what's behind the doors) opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. You are then asked if you'd like to **stick** with your original choice or **switch** to the other unopened door. Which strategy is better?

This project helps you **explore and visualize** the outcomes of both strategies.
